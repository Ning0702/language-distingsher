# language-distingsher

This is a small app to distinguish the language you put through Bash.

This app used the other three npm packages:
 1. franc (https://www.npmjs.com/package/franc)
 2. langs (https://www.npmjs.com/package/langs)
 3. colors (https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors)
 
When the user run index,js and input the language longer than 3 letters, the app will show the best guess about the language name.
